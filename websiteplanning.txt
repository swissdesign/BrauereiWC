Website Plan: Brauerei Andermatt

This plan outlines the development of a new website for Brauerei Andermatt, focusing on a visually stunning user experience, easy content management for the client, and a mobile-first approach.

Phase 1: Pre-Production & Asset Refinement

This initial phase focuses on preparing all the necessary creative and technical assets.
Video Production:
Action: Finalize the "hero" video clips (hero.mp4 and hero.webm).
Key Considerations:
Optimization: While the .webm file is larger, it may offer better compression and quality for web use. We will need to test both to see which provides the best balance of quality and performance.
Seamless Loop: Ensure the video has a smooth loop point to create a continuous and immersive background effect.
SVG Logo Animation:
Action: Extract the SVG logo and its animation code from the "onepager_index.html" file.
Key Considerations:
Code Cleanup: The existing GSAP animation code is excellent and can be repurposed. We will need to make sure it is clean, commented, and optimized for the new site.
Reverse Animation: We will create a reversed version of the animation timeline in GSAP. This will be used for the scroll-based deconstruction of the logo.
Blog/Beer Diary Integration:
Action: Set up a Google Sheet with three columns: "Photos", "Name", and "Caption".
Key Considerations:
Image Hosting: The "Photos" column in the Google Sheet should contain publicly accessible URLs to the images. The client can upload images to a service like Google Photos or a dedicated folder in the website's hosting environment.
API Key: We will need to generate a Google Sheets API key to allow the website to fetch data from the spreadsheet. It is crucial to restrict the API key's access to only the specific Google Sheet to maintain security.
Design Elements:
Action: Finalize the color palette and typography. The existing onepager_index.html file provides a great starting point with its use of --evergreen, --brick-red, and other custom properties. We will expand on this to create a cohesive design system.
Key Considerations:
Font Selection: The combination of 'Montserrat' and 'Playfair Display' from Google Fonts works well. We will ensure these are loaded efficiently.
Backgrounds and Textures: We will use the high-resolution image of the wooden bar from the initial plan, ensuring it's optimized for fast loading1.



Phase 2: Core Website Development

This is where the website's structure and core functionality are built.
Technology Stack:
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript: These will form the foundation of the website.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): This will be used for all animations, including the loading sequence, scroll-based logo deconstruction, and other interactive elements. The existing onepager_index.html file already includes GSAP, which we will continue to use.
Tailwind CSS: The onepager_index.html file also uses Tailwind CSS, which is a great choice for building a responsive, mobile-first design quickly and efficiently. We will use the empty style.css file for any custom CSS that cannot be achieved with Tailwind's utility classes.
Key Features to Develop:
Introductory Loading Animation:
Implementation: We will use the extracted SVG logo and GSAP animation to create a loading screen. The animation will play once when a visitor first arrives at the site.
Troubleshooting: We need to ensure the animation is smooth and does not cause a "flash" of unstyled content. We can achieve this by hiding the page content until the animation is complete.
Scroll-Scrubbing Logo Deconstruction:
Implementation: The hero section will feature the video background with the SVG logo overlaid. As the user scrolls down, a GSAP ScrollTrigger will be used to "scrub" through the reversed logo animation, deconstructing it.
Troubleshooting: This is a complex animation that will require careful synchronization between the video playback and the SVG animation. We will need to test this extensively on different devices and browsers to ensure it is smooth and performant.
Beer Diary (Blog):
Implementation: We will write a JavaScript function in the script.js file that uses the Google Sheets API to fetch the data from the spreadsheet. The data will then be dynamically rendered on the page, with the most recent entries appearing first.
Troubleshooting: We need to handle potential API errors gracefully, such as when the Google Sheet is unavailable. We should also implement a caching mechanism to avoid making an API request on every page load, which will improve performance.
Responsive and Mobile-First Design:
Implementation: We will use Tailwind CSS's responsive design features to ensure the website looks and functions perfectly on all devices. The layout will adapt to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
Troubleshooting: The sideways scrolling section from the original plan could be challenging to implement on mobile devices. We will need to consider a more traditional vertical scrolling experience for smaller screens to ensure usability, as suggested in the clarifying questions of the original plan2.



Phase 3: Content Integration & Interactivity

This phase brings the website to life with content and interactive elements.
Content Implementation:
The product descriptions and other text from the initial plan will be integrated into the new design3.


The "Brewery" and "Owner" sections will be accessible through intuitive navigation elements, as outlined in the original plan4.


Interactivity & User Experience:
We will refine all animations and scrolling effects to be smooth and intuitive5.


Interactive elements, such as buttons and links, will have clear hover and click states to provide visual feedback to the user.

Phase 4: Final Touches & Deployment

The final phase before the website goes live.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
We will implement basic on-page SEO best practices, such as using descriptive meta tags and optimizing images for search engines6.


Performance Optimization:
We will optimize all assets, including images and videos, to ensure the website loads quickly7.


Launch & Promotion:
Once the website is launched, we will announce it on social media and other channels to drive traffic8.


This comprehensive plan provides a clear roadmap for creating a stunning and functional website for Brauerei Andermatt. By combining the best elements of the previous plan with the new ideas, we can create a truly "wow" website that will impress visitors and help the brewery grow its online presence.
